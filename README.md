# Main-Course Homepage Project

Created by Leah Erickson, Eric Miller, Jonathan Winter, and Connor McGrew

## Description

This program functions as a homepage, allowing the user to immediately search for stocks and various news types. On landing, the page displays welcome at the top, and allows the user to search for specific stocks, or click a button that will display the "top news".

## Usage

Popular stocks will automatically populate, however the user may search for specific stocks using the search function provided. The user may also click either of the news buttons to select the type of news they would like to see.
